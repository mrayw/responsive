<p>We at Durham's Tracklements are passionate about providing the highest quality smoked salmon for your enjoyment, and committed to providing the highest quality service to our mail order customers. We have been shipping Tracklements since 1993, and greatly value the appreciation and loyalty of our customers across the country, many of whom have been ordering from us for just as long.<br>
  We feel that what sets us well apart from other mail order smoked salmon purveyors is:</p>
  <ul class="lead-quote">
    <li>Our smoked salmon specialties are made to order, by us, so our products arrive in the best possible condition
    We ship according to when you'd like your package received, not when we're ready to fill your order.</li>
    <li>We offer a variety of smoked salmon specialties for a customized mix, and we can cut and pack in sizes that are most convenient for your intended use.</li>
    <li>We welcome phone calls, particularly for a first order, but are also happy to correspond by email.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Our basic package is $75.00, which includes 1.5#s cold-smoked salmon, vacuum-packed by the unsliced piece for best flavor and keeping quality, and UPS 2nd Day Air shipping.  2nd day air shipping is October-April.  To ensure that our salmon arrives to you in optimal condition, we ship only UPS Next Day Air from May-September, with a UPS surcharge of $15.00-$25.00, depending on destination and package weight. This option is also available the rest of the year. Unfortunately, we cannot ship to any address outside of the U.S.A. Not even to Canada...<br>
  For orders that are being shipped to addresses within the UPS Ground next day delivery area (Michigan and northernmost Ohio), the price for our basic package is $65.00.<br>
  You may receive your order in one 1.5# piece, two 3/4# pieces or three 1/2# pieces, all of one variety or a mix of your choice. Additional half-pound pieces, in the same box to the same address, are $15.00 each, with a maximum of three pounds in our standard shipper. Our usual shipping days are Mondays and Tuesdays for 2nd Day Air and Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays for NDAir.
  We can ship larger and/or special orders with sufficient notice (ten days is ideal); price will be determined by weight and size of shipper.<br>

  <p>If you reach our answering machine, please leave a message--we always return our calls as promptly as possible and we are in and out of the shop on days that we’re not officially open, however, if your salmon need is urgent, email is the fastest way to reach us (please include a phone number at which we can contact you as well as your time zone).<br>
